•	Analyzed the performances and advantages of Modified Risk Parity method and Full-scale Optimization method, using Mean-variance Optimization as a benchmark (Python)
•	Concluded the most suitable use case for each portfolio under certain scenarios to came up with an overall investment strategy for financial advising purposes

In this academic paper project, we take a close look at the asset allocation methods that robo-advising may use based on 'Robo Advisors: quantitative methods inside the robots' by Mikhail Beketov, Kevin Lehmann, and Manuel Wittke. Its study shows majority of the robo advisors are still using the Modern Portfolio Theory in terms of modification and augments instead of developing new methods. Later in this paper, we tested the efficiency of three different portfolio weighting schemes used in Robo Advising: mean-variance analysis, full-scale optimization, and risk parity, using empirical methodology. We concluded that the full-scale optimization method with kinked utility function gains no advantage, while the same method with the S-shaped method can outperform the traditional mean-variance method. Meanwhile, despite similar performance with mean-variance by risk parity most of the time, it can make a change during worse scenarios.
